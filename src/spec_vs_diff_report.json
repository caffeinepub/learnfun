  "summary": "Implemented a service worker (precache + runtime caching), registered it via frontend/index.html (without touching main.tsx), and added early Android bridge detection to set window.__AUDIO_CONFIG__.androidOnly. Documentation updates for an Android Kotlin MainActivity example appear missing/incomplete in the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Update documentation to include a final, copy/paste-ready Android Kotlin MainActivity example that configures WebView for offline-friendly caching and reliable audio playback, loads https://learnfun-h93.caffeine.xyz/, and exposes the AndroidAudio and BackgroundAudio JS interfaces.",
      "reason": "The diff shows frontend/README.md updates about offline support and audio files, but does not show the required self-contained Kotlin MainActivity code block or any mention of addJavascriptInterface calls for AndroidAudio/BackgroundAudio, WebView cache mode, or loading the specified URL. The README content shown is truncated and ends before any Kotlin snippet appears.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Updated/added internal tracking metadata (project_state.json) unrelated to the specified functional requirements.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for changes to project tracking files; only offline SW, SW registration, Android audio config runtime behavior, and README Kotlin snippet were requested.",

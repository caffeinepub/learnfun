  "summary": "Diff does not provide sufficient evidence that the Spanish (es) translation pack was fully implemented as requested; the shown portion of `translations.ts` only includes `commonTranslations` and is truncated before any `es` entry is visible. Two non-requested metadata/summary files were also modified.",

      "requirement": "Replace the current `es: commonTranslations` fallback with an explicit Spanish (`es`) dictionary in `frontend/src/lib/translations.ts`, providing Spanish values for all keys in `commonTranslations` (preserving emojis/icons) without changing other languages.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for `frontend/src/lib/translations.ts` only shows the `commonTranslations` object and is truncated before any language map/object where an explicit `es` dictionary would be visible. Therefore, it cannot be verified that `es` was changed from a fallback reference to a full Spanish dictionary, nor that all keys are covered.",

  "summary": "The diff shows edits to `frontend/src/lib/translations.ts`, but the provided truncated excerpt does not include the `translations` object entries for `fr` or `de`, so the requested explicit French/German dictionaries cannot be verified from the available evidence. Additionally, two non-requested files (`frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`) were modified.",
